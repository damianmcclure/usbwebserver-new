# usbwebserver-new
My own continuation of "UsbWebServer", a portable web development platform for USBs

## Description
This is UsbWebServer updated to php 5.6.31
It also includes other stuff as well...

## Addons
phpAlphaDB Comes Pre-installed, Put this at the top of your file.
-> include("../library/phpAlphaDB/core.php");

Also you can manage phpAlphaDB by going to
-> http://localhost:<port>/phpalphaadmin

Thats it for now, this is UsbWebServer v8.6.1
(I have nothing to do with the original developer)
